# GenesisMUD Webclient Player Scripts
Welcome to my collection of [GenesisMUD](genesismud.org) Webclient scripts.

This project was made for my friends, but it is also open to all other GenesisMUD players.

## Navigation
For an overview of what scripts are here, see [scripts.md](scripts.md).

All scripts can be found in the `scripts` folder. Scripts are arranged in folders by functionality. Each script folder should contain the following:
  * At least one `aliases` folder or one `triggers` folder containing the scripts
  * A `readme.txt` summarizing the scripts

Although it is JS, most of the scripts are installed by copy-pasting into the webclient interface, and so the text file format is chosen to simplify things.

## Using the scripts
All scripts are applied by copy-pasting into the webclient interface, unless special cases are stated in a script's README.

* The repository can be explored here in Github. *When copying the script files, it is recommended to click on the "Raw" button located on the upper right of the file preview so Ctrl-A ("Select all" shortcut) can be used especially for long scripts.*

* This whole repository can be downloaded in a .zip file for exploring and modifying offline. For the unfamiliar: this can be done by clicking the button that says "Code" (found on the top right of the repository's root directory preview), and then by clicking the button that says "Download ZIP".

* The repository can be cloned with Git (but I will assume you know your way around when you use Git so I will not explain this).
